Higher-Order Functions

Abstraction

In the context of programming, these kinds of vocabularies are usually called abstractions. Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level.

Functions that operate on other functions either by taking them in as arguments or by returning them.
Are called higher order functions.

Higher order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values. They come in several forms.
ie. You can have functions that create new functions, functions can change other functions and you can
even write functions that provide new types of control flow.

JSON is similar to Javascripts way of writing arrays and objects with a few restrictions. All property
names have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowed -- no function
calls, variables, or anything that involves actual computation. Comments are not allowed in JSON

Transforming with map

The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new
array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its
content will be "mapped" to a new form by the function.

Like forEach and filter, map is also a standard method on arrays.

Summarizing with Reduce.

Another common pattern of computation on arrays is computing a single value from them. One example is
the summing of a collection of numbers.

The parameters to the reduce function apart from the array are  a combining function and a start value.
