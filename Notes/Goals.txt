Goals:
1.ZONE:  set what you are coding for the day - ie: choose a project say from the algorithm book

2. make sure you have your dev environment setup : github, webstorm,

3. bring your work to date - it should all be in github from code to documentation and lets have ellis take a quick peak and give comments

4. see how we work
- stay focused, stay in your zone
- there is something to learn form everybody - both good and bad!
- your enemy: hesitation, distraction, multitasking, focus (not being patient when you get stuck).

5. after a few days you will come away with the tools of DevOps  (not as a master but as something to master)
- first is the basics of what you are doing now :Javascript and Python development
- OpenAPI (swagger tools)  (how small application services talk to each other across the cloud)
- Linux, Docker, Kubernetes
- google analytics
- products like RightScale (that support heterogeneous cloud environments)
- tools like Puppet (might be too big)
** do not get distracted this is stuff you read when you are not in your zone
