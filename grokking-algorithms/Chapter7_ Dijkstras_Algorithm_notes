7.1 In the following Graphs what is the weight of the shortest path from start to finish

A. The path is 5 - 2 - 1 For a total weight of 8
B. The path is 10 - 20 - 30. For a total of 60.
C. NO shortest path is possible as a negative weight edge is present.

Summary:

Breadth-first-search is used to calculate the shortest path of an unweighted graph
Dijktra's Algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph
Dijktra's algorithm works when all the weights are positive
If you have any negative weights, use the Bellman ford Algorithm
